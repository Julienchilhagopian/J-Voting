= Profile Interfaces documentation

====== Before jumping into the profiles we strongly advice you to read link:preferenceInterfaces.adoc[the preference section].

== Profile definition +
A profile is a list of all the alternatives ranking made by each indivual in a society. In another words, *it is a list matching a person with its preference*. 

== Complete profile +
A profile is consireded as complete if all the voters produced their preferences according to *the same set of alternatives*. 

== Incomplete profile +
An Incomplete profile would mean that *the alternatives included in each voter's preference can be different*. +
For example, some of the voters didn't know about the existence of some alternative or they included, in their choice, an external alternative not part of the main set. 


== Strict profile + 
In each individual preferences, they can not be alternatives that are equally ranked. In other words, all the preferences linked to each voters are considered as Anti Symmetric.
