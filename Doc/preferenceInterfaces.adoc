= Preferences Interfaces Documentation



=== Preference definition +
A Preference is the ranking between Alternatives.



=== MutablePreference +
A Preference where you can add Alternatives (only one by one). +
You can also add two relations between Alternatives : 

* The first one is "At least as good".
* The second one is "Equivalence".

=== AntiSymmetricPreference +
A Preference where there is no "Equivalence" relation between Alternatives. +
The only possible relation is "Greater than".

=== ImmutablePreference +
A Preference where we can't add Alternatives or any relations.

=== MutableAntiSymmetricPreference +
// AntiSymmetricPreference + MutablePreference

=== ImmutableAntySymmetricPreference +
// AntiSymmetricPreference + ImmutablePreference

=== CompletePreference +
An ImmutablePreference where all the Alternatives have a two-to-one relation. +
A CompletePreference represents a complete preorder, also called a weak order.

=== LinearPreference +
// CompletePreference + AntiSymmetricPreference
