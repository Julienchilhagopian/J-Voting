In the last java iteration, we have focused our work on the attribute MutableGraph. Now, we understood that it would be easier for the user to have as a parameter the List<Alternative>.

The goal is to modify the MutableLinearPreference class with methods that take list<Alternative> rather than MutableGraph as parameters and update these lists with the different possible functionalities. The methods will also update the corresponding Mutablegraph.

Specifically, we need to modify the following methods :

* size(List<Set<Alternative>> list) that we will rename atlernativeNumber.
* contains(Alternative alter). This method uses the toAlternativeSet method but be careful, in the OldCP the method accepts a List<Set<Alernative>> and in the new one only a ImmutableList<ImmutableSet<Alernative>>.
* hasSameAlternatives(OldCompletePreferenceImpl p).
* isIncludedIn(OldCompletePreferenceImpl p).
* isStrict().
* toStrictPreference().
