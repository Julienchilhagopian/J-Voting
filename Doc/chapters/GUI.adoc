=== GUI Class Diagram

=== Rows definition +
This visualization displays the list of the voters on the first column and for each of them, their associated preference on the same row.

Example :

_Example based on the current GUI_

In the case above, Voter 2 chose to put the 10th alternative at the first rank, the 1st at the second rank and the 3rd at the last rank. 

=== Columns definition +
This visualization displays the list of the voters on the first row and for each of them, their associated preference on the same column.

Example :

_Example based on the current GUI_

In the case above, Voter 6 chose to put the 2nd alternative at the first rank, the 5th at the second rank and the 7th at the last rank. 

=== Wrapped definition +
This visualization enables to see how many voters have the same preference ( in other words the same order of alternatives). This number is displayed on the row at the top of the table and below the order we are talking about.

Example :

_Example based on the current GUI_

In the case above, 263 Voters have chosen the same preference. They put the 2nd alternative at the first rank, then the 1st and the 3rd one to finish.

=== GUI Usage System

Currently, the GUI enables the user to view a SOC profile (either in rows, columns or wrapped visualization). For the moment the GUI only accepts .soc files already filled.

We plan to allow the user to create a profile through the graphical user interface. In other words, the user should be able to create a profile file, alternatives, voters and complete preferences. Moreover, the user will be able to modify an existing profile by adding some voters (with their preference) and to reorganize preferences (for a strict profile). Therefore, we plan to implement additional methods in the GUI classes.

=== GUI Modeling

We used link:https://wireframesketcher.com/[WireFrame Sketcher]  to design a modeling of our project. You can look at the interactive link:https:https://github.com/Julienchilhagopian/J-Voting/raw/master/Doc/model/storyboard.pdf[PDF] (download to be able to benefit from the interactions) to better understand our GUI.
