= Annex 2. MutableLinearPreference

====== link:../README.adoc[Summary]

This iteration aims to finalize the Mutable Linear Preference class.

Specifically, we have to modify several files :

== MutableLinearPreferenceImpl.java

The big change is to work from now on with a transitively closed graph.

* LinkedList<Alternative> list become List<Alternative> list

* Delete the constructor and the factory method which takes a Graph in parameter

* Modify swap(Alternative alternative1, Alternative alternative2)

* Modify changeOrder(Alternative alternative1, int rank)

* Modify deleteAlternative(Alternative a) and addAlternative(Alternative a)

* Modify equals() and hashcode() to respect the BP Local design

* Rename deleteAlternative(Alternative a) to removeAlternative(Alternative a)

* Transitively close the graph in the whole class (constructors + methods), and recalculate the closure after each modification

== MutableLinearPreferenceImplTest.java

* Add a test that verifies that the graph returned by asGraph is transitively closed and a test that affects g = pref.asGraph() then modifies pref then verifies that g has changed as it should

* Modify all existing tests using the constructor that takes a list as a parameter

* Test the decorators

== MutableLinearSetDecorator.java

In this class, we have to override methods likely to break the linearity of preference by the set. This class extends ForwardingSet<Alternative> and takes a MutableLinearPreference in parameter.

We will override the following methods :

* public boolean add(Alternative a) 
		
* public boolean addAll(Collection<? extends Alternative> c) 
		
* public boolean remove(Alternative a) 

* public boolean removeAll(Collection<? extends Alternative> c) 
		
* public boolean clear() 
		
* public boolean retainAll(Collection<? extends Alternative> c) 

== MutableLinearGraphDecorator.java

We need a decorator because the asGraph() method must return an unmodifiable Graph. By definition, a Graph is modifiable. However, it can be casted as MutableGraph which can be modifiable. So we have to protect our graph from casting.

This class takes a MutableLinearPreference in parameter and should implement https://github.com/google/guava/blob/master/guava/src/com/google/common/graph/ForwardingGraph.java[ForwardingGraph]. 

== MutableStrictProfile.java

Currently, all of the profile are Immutable. With this new class, we need a profile Mutable. The preferences are Strict and complete so it will implement StrictProfile interface. It will be mutable and going to use mutable linear preferences.

Currently, we have 4 Immutable profiles in J-voting :

If we keep the same scheme for the Mutable profiles, then we will need to create three classes as below :

After a talk with you, we decided to create the MutableStrictProfile class regardless of the existing hierarchy. This method has a  Map<Voter, MutableLinearPreference> and a BiMap<Alternative, String> attributes.

We chose to implement the following methods according to our GUI project :

== Alternative.java
 
 * Modify toString() according to BP Local Design
