=== SOC file

Currently, the application only allows us to use .soc files as input.
A .soc file represents a strict complete profile _(for more information see link:./ProfileInterface.adoc[2.1])_.

If you want to create your own one, you have to imagine a profile and to follow some writing rules.
Here is an example of a .soc file and its meaning.

Some other formats exist but will deal with them later _(you can have a look to the link:./FilesFormats.adoc[files formats documentation])_
