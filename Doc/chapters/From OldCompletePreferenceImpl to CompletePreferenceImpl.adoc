|Contract

|getAlternative(Integer position)
|getAlternatives(int rank)
|Returns the alternative at ghe given rank.


|size(List<Set<Alternative>> list)
|/
|Returns the number of alternatives in the preference.

|contains(Alternative alter)
|/
|Says whether an alternative is the preference.

|hasSameAlternatives(OldCompletePreferenceImpl p)
|/
|Says whether two preferences have the same alternatives (not in the same order).

|isIncludedIn(OldCompletePreferenceImpl p)
|/
|Says whether the preference is included in given one ( if it contains all alternatives of the given preference).

|getAlternativeRank(Alternative alter)
|getRank(Alternative a)
|Returns the rank of a given alternative.

|toAlternativeSet(List<Set<Alternative>> preference)
|toALternativeSet(ImmuatbleList<ImmutableSet<Alternative>> preference)
|Returns a alternatives Set with all the alternatives in the List of Sets.

|isStrict()
|/
|Says whether the preference is strict (no ex√¶quo).

|toStrictPreference()
|/
