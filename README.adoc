= Java Iteration plan

== Iteration 1 

*Jade & Thomas* :

Our objective is to replace OldCompletePreferenceImpl used in the whole project by CompletePreferenceImpl. The first step of this goals consists in analysing the OldCompletePreferenceImpl way of functioning and improving the CompletePreferenceImpl class. 

Details are visible here : link:https://github.com/Julienchilhagopian/J-Voting/pull/2[PR#2]. 


*Pierre & Léo* :

Our goal on this iteration is to create a MutableLinearPreferenceImpl class and the interface which implements MutableLinearPreference. This class aims to work on mutable and linear preferences. The number of alternatives can thus evolve, one alternative cannot be equal to another and all the alternatives are comparable two by two.

SM/PO

== Iteration 2

*Jade & Julien* :

The main goal is still to move towards removing the OldCompletePreferenceImpl class. This time the objective is to upgrade CompletePreferenceImpl without impacting the CompletePreference Interface and respecting the comments of the link:https://github.com/Julienchilhagopian/J-Voting/pull/2[PR#2]. 
Once that the upgraded version of CompletePreferenceImpl is done, this class will be able to replace the OldCompletePreferenceImpl class used in the whole project.

A detailed report of the CompletePreferenceImpl futur evolutions can be found link:Doc/chapters/FromOldCompletePreferenceImplToCompletePreferenceImpl.adoc[here].

*Léo & Thomas* :

In the last java iteration, we have focused our work on the attribute MutableGraph. Now, we understood that it would be easier for the user to have as a parameter the List<Alternative>. The goal is to modify the MutableLinearPreference class with methods that take list<Alternative> rather than MutableGraph as parameters and update the Set<Alternative>  with the different possible functionalities. The methods will also update the corresponding Mutablegraph. 

*Pierre* :

SM/PO

== Iteration 3

*Jade & Thomas* :

In this iteration, we will focus on the removal of the constructor that took a graph as a parameter and on the transitive closure of the graph in the whole class (constructor + methods). We will also work on two decorator classes (one for the set and one for the graph).

You can check the details link:Doc/chapters/MutableLinearPreferenceImplChanges.adoc[here].
